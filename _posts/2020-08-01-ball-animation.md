<style>

  #ball {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    position: relative;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: linear-gradient(
      35deg,
      #ccffff,
      #ffcccc
    );
    animation-name: bounce;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: 3;
  }

  @keyframes bounce{
    0% {
      top: 0px;
    }
    50% {
      top: 249px;
      width: 130px;
      height: 70px;
    }
    100% {
      top: 0px;
    }
  }
</style>
<div id="ball"></div>

In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting `animation-iteration-count: infinite;`
