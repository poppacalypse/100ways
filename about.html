      <br>⭐️ &nbsp; Latest experiment:
      {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        {% assign words = post.content | number_of_words %}
        <span style="font-size: 0.65rem; color: #00b490">
        {% if words < 360 %}
          1 MIN READ
        {% else %}
          {{ words | divided_by:180 }} MINS READ

    <p>If you're reading this, it means you most likely have a laptop or a mobile phone. And it 100% means you have access to WiFi or a data plan.</p>

    <p>It also means you already have the tools to make some extra income online, even if it's just a few dollars.</p>

    <p>It's not a guarantee, but I hope it inspires you and lets you know that there is always a way.</p>

    <p>I'm saying there are Ways to do it, but I'm not saying it's going to be easy. There's effort involved, even for the "Idling" methods - you'll still need to do a bit of work for the initial setup at least.</p>
